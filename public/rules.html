    <p>
        To begin, one player is chosen at random and from there play moves clockwise around the table. Each player in turn rolls 
        all six dice and checks to see if they have rolled any scoring dice or combinations. (See Scoring Above.) Any
        dice that score may be set aside and then the player may choose to roll all the remaining dice. The player must
        set aside at least one scoring die of their choice if possible but is not required to set aside all scoring dice.
    </p>
    <p>
        If all six dice have been set aside for scoring (known as having “hot dice”), the player can choose to roll all six
        dice again and continue adding to their accumulated score or they can bank their points, end their turn, and pass the
        dice to the next player.
    </p>
    <p>
        A player’s turn continues until either they decide to stop and score their accumulated points or until they fail to roll 
        any scoring dice on a throw.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a player scores no points on a roll, this is known as a Farkle. The player may continue to roll any dice that 
        have not been previously set aside for scoring, but all of their points gained so far that turn are lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>On a player's first turn of the game they must play a minimum of 500 points to begin scoring.</b>
